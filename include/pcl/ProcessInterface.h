 * \namespace pcl::InterfaceFeature
 * \brief     Provides symbolic constants defining feature flags to customize
 *            process interfaces.
 *
 * Besides defining their specific GUI components and behavior, process
 * interfaces can be customized in a standardized way by means of a series of
 * flags that control the contents and functionality of their <em>interface
 * control bars</em>. Those flags are defined through symbolic constants in the
 * InterfaceFeature namespace.
 *
 * An interface control bar is a managed control located at its parent
 * interface window's bottom side. It is a relatively small panel where a
 * number of standard tool buttons and a one-line text area can be customized.
 *
 * A standard process interface window has the following layout in PixInsight:
 *
 * <pre>
 *    +---------------------------------+
 *    |      Interface Title Bar        +
 *    +---------------------------------+
 *    |                                 |
 *    |     Module-Defined              |
 *    |     Interface Client Area       |
 *    |                                 |
 *    +---------------------------------+
 *    | Info Area                       |
 *    +---------------------------------+
 *    | D A G T E X             B V P R |
 *    +---------------------------------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * Where the two sections at the bottom form the interface's
 * <em>control bar</em>:
 *
 * \li <b>Info Area</b> is a one-line text label that can be used to provide
 * some feedback and information to the user. The contents of the info area can
 * be modified programmatically, but cannot be changed by the user.
 *
 * \li <b>D = %Process Drag %Object</b>, used to create a new process instance
 * by dragging it with the mouse. The new instance can be dragged for execution
 * on selected views, to create process icons, to add instances to a process
 * container, etc.
 *
 * \li <b>A = Apply button</b>, used for execution of a new process instance on
 * the current view or window.
 *
 * \li <b>G = Apply Global button</b>, used for execution of a new process
 * instance in the global context.
 *
 * \li <b>T = Real-Time %Preview button</b>, to attach this interface to the
 * real-time previewing system.
 *
 * \li <b>E = Execute button</b>, used to commit execution of a dynamic
 * interface.
 *
 * \li <b>X = Cancel button</b>, used to cancel execution of a dynamic
 * interface.
 *
 * \li <b>B = Browse Documentation button</b>. When this button is activated,
 * the default behavior is to open the Documentation Browser interface and load
 * it with the documentation for the process for which this open the %Process
 * Explorer window and show the .
 *
 * \li <b>V = Track %View check box</b>. When this check box is checked, the
 * interface should modify its behavior in some way as a function of the
 * current view. This check box generates calls to
 * ProcessInterface::TrackViewUpdated(). Interfaces using this feature
 * also need receiving ProcessInterface::ImageFocused() notifications.
 *
 * \li <b>P = Preferences button</b>, to open a modal dialog box where
 * process and interface-specific preferences can be edited.
 *
 * \li <b>R = Reset button</b>, to reset the current instance to a default
 * state.
 *
 * The following symbolic constants have been publicly defined for interface
 * feature flags:
 *
 * <table border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0">
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::None</td>                      <td>This effectively suppresses a interface's control bar</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::DragObject</td>                <td>%Process drag object - To generate new process instances</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::ApplyToViewButton</td>         <td>Apply button - To execute a process on the active view</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::ApplyGlobalButton</td>         <td>Apply Global button - To execute a process in the global context</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::RealTimeButton</td>            <td>Real-Time Preview button - To activate the real-time preview interface</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::ExecuteButton</td>             <td>Execute button - To commit a dynamic interface</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::CancelButton</td>              <td>Cancel button - To cancel a dynamic interface</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::BrowseDocumentationButton</td> <td>Browse documentation button - Browse process-specific documentation</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::TrackViewButton</td>           <td>Track View check box - To activate/deactivate tracking of the current view</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::PreferencesButton</td>         <td>Preferences button - To edit process and interface-specific preferences</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::ResetButton</td>               <td>Reset button - To reset process instance parameters</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::InfoArea</td>                  <td>Info Area - To create a single-line text area</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::Default</td>                   <td>A default set of flags for static interfaces</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::DefaultGlobal</td>             <td>A default set of flags for static interfaces that execute globally</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>InterfaceFeature::DefaultDynamic</td>            <td>A default set of flags for dynamic interfaces</td></tr>

 *
 * More functionality can be added to interface control bars in future
 * PixInsight and PCL releases.

    * \param process    Reference to the metaprocess describing the process
    *                   class that is launching this interface, either directly
    *                   as its default interface, or through an existing
    *                   process instance.
    *
    * \param instance   Address of a process instance that is trying to launch
    *                   this interface, or zero if it is being launched
    *                   directly as the default interface of the \a process.
    *
    * \param[out] dynamic  True if this interface wants to be launched in
    *                   dynamic mode; false if this interface will launch as a

    *
    * This function is called whenever an interface is about to be \e launched.
    * An interface can be launched either directly as the default interface of
    * a process class (e.g., from PixInsight's %Process Explorer window), or
    * through an existing process instance (e.g., by double-clicking a process
    * icon). The argument values identify the process class and, if nonzero,
    * the process instance.
    *
    * This function must return true if it accepts to be launched under the
    * conditions specified by the arguments. After successfully launching an
    * interface from a process instance (i.e., if \a instance is nonzero), the
    * ValidateProcess() member function is invoked with a reference to the
    * instance. If the instance is validated, the ImportProcess() function is
    * finally called.
    *
    * If this function returns true, the \a dynamic referenced argument
    * variable must be set to \c true if this interface wants to start in
    * dynamic mode. If an interface launches in dynamic mode, a final call to
    * EnterDynamicMode() will occur before the interface window is shown and/or
    * activated. Note that the actual <em>dynamic session</em> will not really
    * start until a first view is selected by the user to serve as a
    * <em>dynamic target.</em>
    *
    * <b>Interface Initialization</b>
    *
    * Initializing an interface means building its sub-controls and setting up
    * a number of important control features, such as a window title, colors,
    * fonts, adjusting sizes, and so on. This job can be done by reimplementing
    * the Initialize() member function, which the PixInsight core application
    * calls as soon as the control handle of this interface becomes valid, that
    * is, just after the window holding this interface has been created.
    *
    * However, the Initialize() function is now deprecated and the standard way
    * to initialize an interface is by reimplementing its %Launch() function to
    * perform the initialization work <em>the first time the interface is
    * launched</em>. This technique is known as <em>deferred initialization</em>
    * of a process interface, and has the important advantage that it minimizes
    * resources and memory usage because an interface is only initialized if it
    * is ever used. Most interfaces are almost never launched by the user,
    * except on special occasions, so investing resources for them continually
    * is inefficient in general. All standard PixInsight interfaces use the
    * deferred initialization technique for that reason.
    *
    * However, developers using the deferred initialization technique must be
    * very careful to ensure that their interfaces will never try to access any
    * child controls and other interface elements prior to initializing them.
    * This is particularly important if an interface responds to platform
    * notifications or events generated by other controls.
    *
    * \note The default implementation of this function sets \a dynamic = false
    * and returns true, so all process interfaces are static by default.
