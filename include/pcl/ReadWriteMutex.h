 * \class ReadWriteMutex
 * \brief Client-side interface to a PixInsight read/write mutex object
 *
 * %ReadWriteMutex provides separate thread synchronization for read and write
 * operations. This can be more efficient than plain Mutex synchronization
 * because multiple threads can access a data item for read-only operations
 * simultaneously, which in turn improves concurrency if write accesses are
 * relatively infrequent.
