 * \class RedundantMultiscaleTransform
 * \brief Base class of all redundant multiscale transforms.
 *
 * A redundant multiscale transform produces a set {w1,w2,...,wN,cN}, where
 * each wj is a set of coefficients at scale j, which we call <em>detail
 * layer</em>, and cN is a large-scale smoothed residual, which we call
 * <em>residual layer</em>. Each layer has the same dimensions as the input
 * image, so the generated multiscale transform is called \e redundant. Two
 * well-known examples of redundant multiscale transform algorithms are the
 * <em>Ã  trous</em> (with holes) wavelet transform, also known as <em>starlet
 * transform</em>, and the multiscale median transform.
 *
 * In all cases the reconstruction algorithm consists of the sum of all wj
 * multiscale layers for 1 <= j <= N, plus the residual layer cN.
 *
 * In our implementation, each layer in a redundant multiscale transform is a
 * floating-point image with the same dimensions as the transformed image.
 * Layers are indexed from 0 to N. Layers at indexes from 0 to N-1 are
 * detail layers, whose elements are actually difference coefficients. Pixel
 * samples in a detail layer can be negative, zero or positive real values.
 *
 * The last layer, at index N, is the large-scale residual layer. Pixel samples
 * in the residual layer image can only be positive or zero real values.
