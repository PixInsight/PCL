 * \class KDTree
 * \brief Bucket PR K-d tree for point data in arbitrary dimensions.
 *
 * An n-dimensional K-d tree is a specialized binary tree for partitioning of
 * a set of points in an n-dimensional space. K-d trees have important
 * applications in computational geometry problems requiring efficient
 * rectangular range searching.
 *
 * This class implements a <em>bucket point region K-d tree</em> structure
 * (see Reference 2).
 *
 * The template type argument T represents the type of a \e point object stored
 * in a %KDTree structure. The type T must have the following properties:
 *
 * \li The standard default and copy constructors are required:\n
 * \n
 * T::T() \n
 * T::T( const T& )
 *
 * \li The \c T::component subtype must be defined. It represents a component
 * of an object of type T. For example, if T is a vector type, T::component
 * must be the type of a vector component.
 *
 * \li The array subscript operator must be defined as follows:\n
 * \n
 * component T::operator []( int i ) const \n
 * \n
 * This operator must return the value of the i-th component of an object being
 * stored in the K-d tree, such that 0 <= i < N, where N > 0 is the dimension
 * of the point space.
 *
 * \note We use this implementation of K-d trees in some essential PixInsight
 * tools with success (e.g., StarAlignment), and hopefully it will be also
 * useful for you, but we don't claim it to be complete. This is a practical
 * and relatively simple implementation, where only the construction,
 * destruction and range search operations are available. In particular, this
 * implementation does not include point addition, deletion and iteration
 * operations. Future versions of PCL will include more complete
 * implementations of this fundamental data structure.
