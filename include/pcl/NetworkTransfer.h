    *                   default but can be restarted automatically using secure
    *                   connections. The default value is true.

    *                   is true.

    * By default, all %NetworkTransfer objects are initialized to use SSL/TLS
    * if possible for plain text protocols. Authenticity of peer and host
    * certificates are always verified by default. In other words, the default
    * parameter values of this member function reflect the default state of the
