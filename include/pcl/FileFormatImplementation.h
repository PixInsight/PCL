 * \class FileFormatImplementation
 * \brief Implementation of a PixInsight file format instance
 *
 * In the PixInsight/PCL framework, an <em>image file format</em> is formally
 * defined as a descendant of the MetaFileFormat class.
 * %FileFormatImplementation defines the behavior and functionality of a file
 * format instance, which usually (although not necessarily) identifies an
 * <em>image file</em> stored in the corresponding file format.
 *
 * Note that %MetaFileFormat and %FileFormatImplementation describe and
 * implement, respectively, an \e installable image file format in a PixInsight
 * module. All installed file formats can be accessed and instantiated by means
 * of the FileFormat and FileFormatInstance classes, respectively, through
 * intermodule communication mechanisms.
 *
 * \sa MetaFileFormat, FileFormat, FileFormatInstance

    *          (through intermodule communication) may not behave in the same
    *          way. A module must be prepared to receive relative file path

    *          pedestal subtraction, no white balancing) irrespective of the
    *          current DSLR RAW format settings.
    *
    * This function must return a dynamic array of ImageDescription structures
    * that describes the image(s) stored in the opened image file. Each
    * %ImageDescription structure contains ImageInfo and ImageOptions objects
    * that describe both basic image parameters (as geometry and color space)
    * and format-independent image options (pixel format, embedded data, etc).
    *
    * In the event of error, a reimplementation of this member function should
