   <div id="Description">
<p>Arcsinh Stretch is a method of stretching image data while preserving the orignal colour (i.e. the original R,G,B ratios) in every pixel of the image. Colour is retained from the very faintest object to the very brightest unsaturated star.  Contrast this to a traditional "curves" stretch where the brighter objects become desaturated (i.e. bleached) during the stretch.</p>
<img style="" src="images/ArcsinhStretch.jpg" alt=""/>

<p>The user interface has been kept as simple as possible.  There are two important parameters: the black point and the stretch factor.  The process also relies very heavily on the preview window so the results can be judged interactively while adjusting the sliders that control those two key parameters.</p>
<p>The Arcsinh stretch process is designed to be run on linear (i.e. unstretched) data which has been white balanced and background extracted.  When using the preview window, a screen transfer function should not be active because this will upset the appearance of the data in the preview window.</p>

<div class="pidoc_section" id="__Usage__">

   <div id="Usage">

<p>The Arcsinh Stretch process has been designed to be simple, intuitive and fast to use.</p>
<p>When using it for the for the first time simply perform the following steps:
<ul class="pidoc_list">
<li>Ensure the source image window has no <em>Screen Transfer Function</em> active.</li>
<li>Activate the preview window and click the <em>Estimate Black Point </em>button.</li>
<li>Increase the amount of stretch until the faint data appears</li>
<li>Finely adjust the black point to increase/decrease the number of pixels that are clipping to zero</li>
<li>Apply the stretch to the image window (by dragging the blue triangle to the main window or by clicking the blue square)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Assumptions__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.1&emsp;Assumptions</h4>

The Arcsinh Stretch process works best on linear data that has been white balanced and background extracted.  The data should also be linear i.e. no previous non-linear transformation should have been applied (e.g. by using CurvesTransformation by adjusting mid tones on the HistogramTransformation). In addition, if it is desired to take advantage of the powerful real time preview, it is important that no STF (screen transfer function) is active on the image.

</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Black_Point__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.2&emsp;Black Point</h4>

<p>On the Arcsinh Stretch interface it can be seen that the black point adjuster has two sliders.
Users of the PixInsight Convolution process will already be familiar with the concept of having two sliders to control a single parameter, one being a coarse adjustment and the other being a fine adjustment.</p>

<p>The lower slider of the two is for fine adjustment.  Think of it as analogous to a "fine focusing" knob.  The slider re-centres itself whenever you move the mouse away from the slider so you can always finely adjust both up and down from the background level you already have.</p>

<p>The black point has 6 decimal places of precision and using the keyboard Up/Down arrows on the fine adjustment slider will nudge the final digit. PgUp/PgDn gives an adjustment 10x as much.  The mouse wheel gives an adjustment 3x as much.  Failing that, just type the background number in the box - it's easy to overtype the final digit as required.</p>


<p>When stretching by a factor of 100 or more, the very tiniest adjustment of the background value makes a very noticeable difference to the image because its effects are also magnified by a factor of 100 or more!  

However, the keyboard keys UpArrow, DownArrow, PgUp, PgDn and the mouse wheel work fine for nudging the value. </p> 

<p><b>Useful Hint:</b>&nbsp;It is easiest to set the black point with the real time preview window activated and with option set to highlight clipped values. </p>

</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Stretch_Factor__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.3&emsp;<a id="stretch_factor_selection"></a>Stretch Factor</h4>

<p>The Stretch Factor slider has a logarithmic response which allows the same degree of relative control at each end of the scale i.e. near 1 and near 1000.  Values near 1.0 are useful when applying a second iteration of Arcsinh, for instance.</p>

<p>Note that when stretching the faint signal, the background noise is amplified by the same stretch factor.  This amplified background noise will typically be the main constraint on how much stretch you wish to apply.</p>

<p>If the maximum stretch level of 1000 is insufficient then a second iteration of Arcsinh can be applied to the image.</p>

<p>In the example below, the black point has been set and a stretch factor of 50 has been used:</p>
<img style="" src="images/Stretch50.jpg" alt=""/>

<p>Increasing the stretch factor to 300 makes a big difference to this image:</p>
<img style="" src="images/Stretch300.jpg" alt=""/>

<p><b>Useful Hint:</b>&nbsp;For some images it can be advantageous to apply the stretch iteratively. For instance, the example below shows the third iteration using a stretch factor of 6.70.  Since the product of 6.7 three times is approximately 300 (6.7 x 6.7 x 6.7 = 300.7) then the effect is similar but not identical to the above single stretch of 300.  However, the iterative approach has made the nebulosity appear more dramatic. </p>
<img style="" src="images/ThreeIterations.jpg" alt=""/>


</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Preview_Window__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.4&emsp;Preview Window</h4>

<p>The real time preview functionality is a key element for obtaining good results but first make sure that a <em>Screen Transfer Function</em> is not active because that will upset the appearance of the preview.</p>

<p>The real time preview window is activated in the usual manner by clicking on the blue circle icon on the bottom left. When the preview window is activated, the Estimate Black Point button and Highlight Clipped Values option are no longer greyed out.  They are explained in the next sections.</p>
</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Highlight_Clipped_Values__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.5&emsp;Highlight Clipped Values</h4>

<p>This control is accessible only when a preview window is active and only affects what is displayed in the preview window. The colour of the highlighted pixels indicates which colours have been clipped to zero.</p>

<img style="" src="images/EstimateBlackPoint.jpg" alt=""/>

<p>In the example above, the highlighted pixels are mainly red.  This shows that the red channel is weaker and is the first to clip. It might be an indication that better background extraction is required.  As the black point level is increased, the red and green channels will also clip and the colour of the highlighted pixels will turn to white. </p>

<p><b>Useful Hint:</b>&nbsp;Temporarily reduce the stretch factor to make it easier to distinguish the highlighted clipped pixels from the rest of the image. </p>

</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Estimate_Black_Point__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.6&emsp;Estimate Black Point</h4>
<p>This control is accessible only when a preview window is active.  It will set the black point at a level where 2% of pixel values are clipped to zero. This provides a good starting point in most cases.  Sometimes the clipped values are clumped together in a few areas of the image rather than being spread across the image.  This might indicate that further work is required on Background Extraction.<p>


<p>From this starting point of 2% pixel clipping the fine adjustment slider can be used to adjust the black point up or down according to preference.</p>
</div>

<img style="" src="images/EstimateBlackPoint.jpg" alt=""/>

<p>In the example above, the button has been clicked to estimate and set the black point and the option to highlight clipped pixels is activated. The user can then judge whether to adjust the black point up or down from this level.</p>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Protect_Highlights__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.7&emsp;Protect Highlights</h4>

<p>Stretching the image data can cause some data values to saturate (i.e. clip with a value of 1.0).  The Protect Highlights option will identify such pixels and linearly scale the whole image to avoid any individual pixel values becoming saturated.  This will make the final image appear darker.</p>


<p>For users who want a mathematical example of how such clipping can occur, consider an image pixel with RGB value (0.98, 0.25, 0.25).  Since the luminence is less than 1.0 the image pixel will be stretched and this could force the red component to exceed 1.0 and therefore clip.</p>


<p>However, there is a known issue with the Protect Highlights option.  Under some circumstances the stretched image will end up darker than indicated by its real time preview.  This is because the preview works on a smaller sample of the whole image and may not see some of the brighter pixels that exist in the entire image.</p>
</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Use_RGB_Working_Space__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.8&emsp;Use RGB Working Space</h4>
By default, the luminance value of the pixel is calculated from equally weighted RGB values (0.33, 0.33, 0.33).  Setting the RGB Working Space option will use whatever weights are used by the current RGB Working Space e.g. (0.22, 0.72, 0.06).  These weights can be changed by applying the RGBWorkingSpace process to the data.  This can have subtle but interesting results because although individual pixels will still have the correct color balance after stretching, the RGB Working Space can affect the look of the image as a whole by for instance, emphasizing or de-emphasizing areas of red H-alpha emissions or blue reflection nebulosity.
</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Known_Issues__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.9&emsp;Known Issues</h4>
The following is a list of known issues of which the user should be aware.
<ul class="pidoc_list">
<li>In the stretched image, the centres of the brightest stars can sometimes appear discoloured, typically pink. This is caused by camera sensor being saturated by those stars in the original exposures used to create the image.  Arcsinh Stretch will faithfully preserve the discolouration found in the original data.  It can be treated in various ways, for instance an additional HistogramTransformation step or some kind of operation carried out on star centres using an appropriate star mask.</li>

<li>In many images the brighter areas can suffer from a lack of contrast after stretching, compared with some alternative intensity transformations.  This is because a wide range of pixel values have been "squashed" into a narrow range.  Approaches such as MultiscaleLinearTransform may help to ameliorate this lack of contrast.</li>

<li>As mentioned earlier, there is a known issue with the Protect Highlights option.  Under some circumstances the stretched image will end up darker than indicated by its real time preview.  This is because the preview works on a smaller sample of the whole image and may not see some of the brighter pixels that exist in the entire image.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="pidoc_subsection" id="__Usage_:_Possible_Future_Work__">
   <h4 class="pidoc_subsectionTitle">2.10&emsp;Possible Future Work</h4>
There is actually no need to restrict the functional form of the transfer fucntion to be Hyperbolic ArcSine.  Any kind of "curves" function will do just as well.  The key point is that to preserve colour the calculated pixel multiplier must be simultaneously applied to all channels (R,G,B) in the pixel.
</div>

<div class="pidoc_section" id="__mathematical_description__">
   <h3 class="pidoc_sectionTitle">Mathematical Description</h3>
   <div id="mathematical_description">
<p>The methodology is based on a paper by Lupton et al (ref [1]) whose aim was to stretch astronomical images in such a way that colour, especially star colour, is preserved.</p>  


<p>The image data is first scaled into the range [0,1] and then a transfer function is applied to the luminance to boost the intensity of the faint data.  Arcsinh (Hyperbolic ArcSine) is the tranfer function suggested by the paper  The transfer function is linear near zero and becomes increasingly logarithmic as it approaches unity.  Lupton's paper specifies a softening parameter, <em>&beta;</em>, whose purpose is to control the point at which the gradual change from linear to logarithmic takes place.  Colour preservation is ensured by using the same multiplier is applied simultaneously to the RGB colour components.</p>

<p>The softening factor used by Lupton is rather unintuitive so in this implementation a more intuitve stretch factor has been introduced in its place.  This is the multiplicative scalar that is applied to the faintest parts of the image.  Internally, the Arcsinh Stretch process calculates the required softening factor that achieves the amount of stretch requested by the user.</p>

<p>Mathematically this can be written as follows:</p>

<p><em>x = luminance(R,G,B)</em>  &nbsp;&nbsp;where each of <em>R,G,B</em> are in the range [0,1]</p>

<p><em>stretch = asinh(&beta;x)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(x * asinh(&beta;))</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;where <em>&beta;</em> is the softening factor</p>

<p><em>R<sub>stretched</sub> = R * stretch</em></p>
<p><em>G<sub>stretched</sub> = G * stretch</em></p>
<p><em>B<sub>stretched</sub> = B * stretch</em></p>
<p>Note that when <em>x=1</em> (i.e. the luminance is at its maximum value of 1) no stretching takes place because <em>stretch</em> is also 1</p>

<p>When x=0 the stretch is &nbsp;<em>&beta;&nbsp;/&nbsp;asinh(&beta;)</em>&nbsp; which is the asymptote of &nbsp;<em>asinh(&beta;x)&nbsp;/&nbsp;(x * asinh(&beta;))</em>&nbsp; as <em>x</em> reduces to 0</p>

<p>The Arcsinh Stretch process calculates the value the softening factor, <em>&beta;</em>, which gives the user requested stretch at <em>x=0</em></p>
