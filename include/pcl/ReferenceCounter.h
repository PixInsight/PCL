/*!
 * \class ReferenceCounter
 * \brief Thread-safe reference counter for copy-on-write data structures.
 *
 * %ReferenceCounter is used internally by most PCL container and image classes
 * to implement reference-counted, copy-on-write <em>shared data</em>.
 *
 * %ReferenceCounter is a thread-safe reference counter because it implements
 * its internal counter as an instance of the AtomicInt class. This means that
 * counter increment and decrement are implemented as atomic operations.
 *
 * Copy-on-write is a fundamental technique for optimization of resources and
 * execution speed by preventing unnecessary duplication of data, especially
 * when objects are copied and aliased frequently but seldom modified.
 * Basically, a set of objects can share the same data with the condition that
 * the data remains unmodified. In this case, the set of objects is said to be
 * \e referencing a single data item, and all objects in the set are considered
 * as \e aliases of the data. When an alias object tries to modify its
 * referenced data, a new copy is generated on-demand and the object uniquely
 * references the newly generated data, which can then be freely modified. This
 * mechanism works in a completely automatic and transparent way, and
 * %ReferenceCounter just provides a thread-safe counter to keep track of the
 * number of aliased objects that reference the same data structure at a given
 * time, plus a number of useful related functions.
 *
 * \sa AtomicInt
