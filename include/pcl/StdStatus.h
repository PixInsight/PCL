/*!
 * \class StandardStatus
 * \brief A status monitoring callback that sends progress information to the
 *        process console.
 *
 * %StandardStatus uses the processing console associated with the current
 * processing thread to provide feedback and progress information on a
 * process being monitored by a StatusMonitor object.
 *
 * %StandardStatus is suitable for processes where a total <em>status
 * monitoring count</em> can be computed in advance. For example, this happens
 * with processes that operate on a pixel-by-pixel basis and perform a fixed
 * number of iterations, or a number of iterations that can be predicted before
 * running the process. For cases where a total count is not available or
 * cannot be computed, the SpinStatus class is more suitable.
 *
 * %StandardStatus and %SpinStatus are used by all standard PixInsight
 * processes and file formats. Unless a specific module has an extremely good
 * reason to proceed otherwise, we recommend that all modules also use these
 * monitoring classes. This ensures that efficient and coherent feedback is
 * provided to the user on the entire PixInsight platform.
 *
 * In addition, using %StandardStatus (and also %SpinStatus) allows the
 * PixInsight core application to process mouse, keyboard and screen update
 * events. In this way the application's GUI can be responsive if the user
 * requests aborting or suspending the monitored process.
